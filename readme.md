## Introduction

Working with matrices is a fundamental skill in programming, especially in areas such as data science, machine learning, and computer graphics. In this repository, we provide two simple yet essential matrix operations: capturing user input for a 2D matrix and summing two matrices.

## Program 1: User Input for a 2D Matrix

### Logic Explanation

This program is designed to take user input for a 2D matrix of a specified size (rows and columns). The logic involves the following steps:

1. **Matrix Size Input**: The user is prompted to enter the number of rows and columns for the matrix.
2. **Matrix Initialization**: A 2D array (or vector) is initialized based on the input dimensions.
3. **Element Input**: The user is asked to input the elements of the matrix one by one. Nested loops are used to iterate through each element in the matrix, and the input is stored in the corresponding position in the 2D array.

This process results in a fully populated 2D matrix based on user input.

## Program 2: Summing Two Matrices

### Logic Explanation

This program sums two matrices of the same dimensions. The logic can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Matrix Size Validation**: Ensure both matrices have the same dimensions (i.e., the same number of rows and columns). If they do not match, matrix addition is not possible.
2. **Matrix Input**: The user inputs the elements for two matrices, following the same input method described in Program 1.
3. **Matrix Summation**: A new matrix is initialized to store the sum of the two matrices. Nested loops are used to iterate through corresponding elements of the two matrices, adding them together and storing the result in the new matrix.
4. **Output the Result**: The resulting matrix, which contains the sum of the input matrices, is displayed to the user.

This program demonstrates the fundamental operation of matrix addition, which is a critical operation in many mathematical computations.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run these programs, follow these steps:

1. **Compilation**: Use a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`) to compile the programs.
   ```bash
   g++ -o matrix_input matrix_input.cpp
   g++ -o matrix_sum matrix_sum.cpp
